# News Briefing Preferences

This file tracks learned preferences from user feedback to improve article selection over time.

## Topic Interests

### High Priority
- AI and technology industry dynamics
- Tech business strategy and economics
- AI safety, policy, and regulation
- **Technology's impact on society and culture** (and feedback loops)
- **Fintech** and financial services technology
- UK financial services and institutions

### Medium Priority
- UK and international politics
- Economic policy and financial markets
- Tech infrastructure and tools

### Lower Priority
- Consumer tech products (unless broader societal/cultural implications)
- Entertainment and media
- **Internal US politics** (unless broader international impact, especially UK/Italy)

## Article Selection Patterns

### Preferred Article Types
- In-depth analysis over breaking news
- Business strategy and industry dynamics
- Technical deep-dives with economic context
- Policy implications of technology
- International stories (UK, Europe, global implications)
- Avoid internal US politics unless clear international impact

### Source Diversity (IMPORTANT)
- **Always prefer 3 different sources** for deep-dive articles
- Only pick 2 from same source if other options are clearly inferior
- Variety of perspectives matters as much as topic quality

### Avoid
- **Product reviews** (consumer tech reviews, gadget launches, etc.)
- Celebrity/personality-focused stories
- Short breaking news without analysis

## Coverage Balance Preferences

- Headlines roundup: 2-3 minutes (expanded from original 30 seconds)
- Deep-dive articles: 3-4 minutes each (trimmed from original 3-4 minutes)
- Total length: 10-15 minutes

## Voice Preferences

- Use default speak MCP tool voice (not Rachel/ElevenLabs API direct)
- Conversational, engaging tone
- Avoid flat, monotone delivery

## Feedback History

### 2026-02-08
- **Critical issue**: Reused 2 out of 3 articles from previous briefing (Economist dollar article, FT tech crash article)
- **Must check article-history.json** before selecting to avoid repeating articles from past 7 days
- TTS pronunciation issue: "2026" was read as "2020... 26" - use spelled-out format "twenty twenty-six" instead

### 2026-02-07
- Issue: Picked 2 articles from same source (FT) - should always aim for 3 different sources
- Emphasized: Source diversity is as important as topic quality

### 2026-02-13
- **First article (DOJ/Gail Slater antitrust) not very interesting** - internal US politics
- **Second and third articles were good**: NS&I (fintech interest + premium bonds holder) and Ring (owns Ring doorbell)
- Preference: Skip internal US political stories unless they have broader international repercussions
- Especially interested in connections to UK or Italian politics
- Interested in fintech and UK financial services (NS&I premium bonds customer)
- Voice: Adam Stone (ElevenLabs) worked well

### 2026-02-05
- Liked: Musk/SpaceX + xAI merger, Google AI spending, chip market analysis
- All three AI-infrastructure focused articles worked well
- Requested: More room for broader headlines, trim deep-dives slightly
- Voice: Preferred default voice over Rachel (ElevenLabs API)
